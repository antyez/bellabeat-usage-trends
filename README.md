# Product Usage Analysis for Health Tracking Devices

## Main questions of this case study:

1. Are there months with significantly higher proportions of highly active users (≥10k steps) that could indicate optimal timing for marketing campaigns?
2. Can users be grouped into distinct behavioral segments to tailor marketing strategies?
3. Can sleep inefficiency combined with low activity identify users at risk of disengagement who could benefit from targeted motivational campaigns?
