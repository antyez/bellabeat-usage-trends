# Product Usage Analysis for Health Tracking Devices

## Main questions of this case study:

1. Are there months where user activity peaks (measured by the share of users reaching 10k+ daily steps) that could inform marketing budget allocation and campaign timing?
2. Can users be grouped into distinct behavioral segments to tailor marketing strategies?
3. Can sleep inefficiency combined with low activity identify users at risk of disengagement who could benefit from targeted motivational campaigns?
